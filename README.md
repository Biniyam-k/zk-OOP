Introduction to JAVA OOP

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a style of programming characterized by the identification of classes of objects closely linked with the methods (functions) with which they are associated. It also includes ideas of inheritance of attributes and methods. It is a technique based on a mathematical discipline, called “abstract data types,” for storing data with the procedures needed to process that data. OOP offers the potential to evolve programming to a higher level of abstraction.

Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects.

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

The dictionary meaning of an object is "an entity that exists in the real world", and oriented means "interested in a particular kind of thing or entity".
In basic terms, OOP is a programming pattern that is built around objects or entities, so it's called object-oriented programming

OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained. This includes programs for manufacturing and design, as well as mobile applications;

## class 
In a nutshell, classes are essentially user defined data types. Classes are where we create a blueprint for the structure of methods and attributes. Individual objects are instantiated, or created from this blueprint.

A class is a blueprint or template of an object. It is a user-defined data type. Inside a class, we define variables, constants, member functions, and other functionality. it binds data and functions together in a single unit. It does not consume memory at run time.
 - Note that classes are not considered as a data structure. It is a logical entity. It is the best example of data binding. 
 - Note that a class can exist without an object but vice-versa is not possible.-


## object

These are instances of a class with specifically defined data. When a class is defined initially, the description is the only object that is defined.
An object is a real-world entity that has attributes, behavior, and properties. It is referred to as an instance of the class. It contains member functions, variables that we have defined in the class. It occupies space in the memory. Different objects have different states or attributes, and behaviors.

At the point of creation of a class, the description is the first object to be defined. An instance of a class exists in an object. Notably, the system does not allocate any memory space when a 

Methods - These are functions that are defined inside a class that describe the behavior of an object. They are useful for re-usability or keeping functionality encapsulated inside one object at a time. Code re-usability is a great benefit when debugging.
